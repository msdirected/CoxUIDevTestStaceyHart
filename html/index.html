		<p class="newstext">MANHATTAN, Kan &#8212;&#8212;The Longhorns, three games 
		into their defense of the No. 1 ranking, come to a place where the opponent 
		is formidable, the crowd is raucous, and the referees might just wear out 
		their whistles. They come to face No. 13 Kansas State, an in-your-face team 
		that reflects the personality of its coach, Frank Martin. The Wildcats spend 
		much of their games fouling and shooting free throws.</p>
		<p class="newstext">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="newstext">All 12,528 tickets have been sold, and coach Rick Barnes 
		hopes the Longhorns can summon the fortitude Texas A&amp;M showed in the 
		packed Erwin Center on Saturday during a 72-67 loss to the Longhorns in 
		overtime. </p>
		<p class="newstext">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="newstext">"It's gonna be flipped Monday," Barnes said. "We're 
		not gonna have the house. I hope we go in with the same intensity A&amp;M 
		brought."</p>
		<p class="newstext">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="newstext">Kansas State has 13 consecutive victories at home, its 
		longest streak in Manhattan since winning 20 straight in 1981-82. </p>
		<p class="newstext">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="newstext">The Longhorns and Wildcats would not be called rivals, 
		but you couldn't tell by their games in recent seasons. Barnes is 8-4 against 
		Kansas State. </p>
		<p class="newstext">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="newstext">The Longhorns have won four of the last six, but five 
		of those games were decided by four points or fewer. Texas has won the last 
		two in Manhattan. K-State has a two-game winning steak in Austin. </p>
